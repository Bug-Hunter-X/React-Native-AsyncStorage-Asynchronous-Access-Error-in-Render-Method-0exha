In React Native, a common yet easily overlooked error arises when using AsyncStorage.  The issue stems from attempting to access AsyncStorage data asynchronously within a synchronous context, often within a render method.  This leads to unpredictable behavior because the render method is called synchronously, but the AsyncStorage operations are asynchronous, meaning the data may not be available when the component renders, leading to null pointer exceptions or undefined variable errors.  For example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { userData: null };
  }

  async componentDidMount() {
    const user = await AsyncStorage.getItem('user');
    this.setState({ userData: user });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.userData.name}</Text> //Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
