# React Native AsyncStorage Asynchronous Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications when working with AsyncStorage. The problem arises from accessing AsyncStorage data asynchronously within a synchronous context, such as the `render` method. This causes unpredictable behavior because the data might not be available when the component renders.

## Bug Description
Attempting to access AsyncStorage data before it has been fetched asynchronously results in undefined variable errors or null pointer exceptions.  The `render` method expects data synchronously, whereas `AsyncStorage.getItem` is asynchronous and requires awaiting or using a promise mechanism.

## Solution
The solution involves properly handling the asynchronous nature of `AsyncStorage.getItem`.  This is most commonly done using a conditional rendering pattern where data is only rendered once AsyncStorage has provided a result.  The provided solution utilizes `useState` to hold the current data value and only displays it once available.

## How to Reproduce
Clone this repository and run the example app.  Observe the error message indicating that `userData` is undefined in the console.  Compare the original `bug.js` file with the corrected `bugSolution.js` to understand the fix.
